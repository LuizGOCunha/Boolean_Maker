This program has the intention of aiding a user in the creation of a Boolean String
It does that by holding a variety of values that can be used in the search of one single concept,
holding it in a list with many other strings that have the same use but for other values,
then looking into the list of user demands and creating a boolean search string based on that.

It is quite a simple program, but it can be upgraded into something even more useful.
